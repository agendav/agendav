# This file is used by update-rscds-database to set the correct
# permissions for the application user.  In newer installations
# the application user will probably be called app_davical (and
# the administrative user will be called dba_davical) but in
# older installations the application user was called 'general'
# and the administrative user was probably 'postgres'.
#
# See the wiki topic 'Database/Users' for more discussion.
#
# This file includes lines like:
#   GRANT SELECT,...
# which define what gets granted to the following lines like:
#   ON table1, table2, sequence1, function 3, view4, ...
# no user-serviceable parts inside, all whitespace is ignored,
# your mileage should not vary :-)
